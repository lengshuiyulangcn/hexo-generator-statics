### hexo-generator-statics

This extension is used to copy static files into public directory instead of rendering with the templates.

run `npm install hexo-generator-statics --save`

Then put the static files in `statics` in the blog directory.

That's all.

You can also make a directory other than `statics` and modify the `_config.yml` to add your directory name.

```yml
statics_dir: your_dir_name
```
